# rpi-utils
A collection of scripts, instructions and cheat sheets to help with common tasks mainly on Raspberry Pi. Most of this is useful also on other Linux systems and macOS.

## Background
Tasks could be divided into 3 categories. Stuff you do all the time and know by heart. Stuff you do only once or very rarely, so you don't mind searching the Internet for information on how to do it. Neither of these two are worth documenting. 

Then there is a 3rd category which sits between the first two. Stuff you do repeatedly but not very often. You tend to forget some details about how to do it. You also don't want to hunt around for instructions every time. You know you have done it before. For this type of task I wish that I had documented or automated the task. 

That is what the rpi-utils repo is for. Quick access to routines for common tasks.

## Content

### Instructions
Instructions should be short and to the point. They are meant to help you complete a task quickly. They should contain only the most useful information and assume you have some prior knowledge. Instructions are not meant to be beginner tutorials. Instructions are not meant to be complete documentation either. Both of these can be found on the Internet.

Instructions are written in plain text in Markdown format. They should be easy to read in any situation, including in a terminal. Command examples are written as code to make them stand out from the paragraphs.

### Scripts
Scripts are a great way to automate tasks that are tedious to do manually. Scripts must work. They are super annoying when they don't work properly. In that case a good instruction is better than a buggy script. A working script with well written comments can also serve as an instruction.
